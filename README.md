# Predicting-Energy-Consumption-in-a-Building-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques
In this project, I implemented Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, KNN Regression
, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression,
and Artificial Neural Network Regression with Python on Kaggle “Energy Consumption” dataset to forecast energy consumption of a house.
First of all, I explored and then visualized data using some plots. After that, the machine learning project starts. 
Next, 8 mentioned regression models are implemented. Each model is evaluated using 4 functions:  MSE, MAE, MAPE, and R-square.
Comparing the R-squares of each model, it is noticeable that Random Forest Regression has the highest R-square (0.9). 
After that, I tried to improve the accuracy of models with 2 techniques, Feature Selection and Feature Scaling. 
After recruiting these techniques, the linear model with R-square = 0.99 has the highest accuracy.
